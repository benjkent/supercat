## Read Me
### _A simple exploration into the unknown world of Github pages_

## Mission:
- create the repo on github.com under your account
- clone the repo locally to your favorite directory
 > git checkout repo-name
- go to your new directory and create a readme.md file. 

- edit repo locally, save, and add (stage) all files
>git add . 
- commit all changes and add a message of you intent -- ex: create_readme_file
>git commit -m initialcommit
- You will be in the master branch *most likely*
- Rename the "master" branch to "main"
 >git branch -M main
- push you changes up to github repo
 >git push -u origin main
## oops and oboys
- use quotes to "to state your intent" on a commit to make it legable. 
>git commit -m "my intent with this commit is"
- make sure you actually saved the file locally. CMD + s or whatever your IDE requires. Git does not auto save you work. 
> git is magic, but it does not save you work. -you've been warned.
